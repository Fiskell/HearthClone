## Hearthstone Engine Clone

An attempt at an exact copy of the mechanics in hearthstone.  The project is written with full TDD and uses Laravel 5.1

There will eventually be routes exposed to start a game, but wowza that is far away.

Composer install

npm install

## Hearthstone API

Coming soon


## Next Steps

  - basic
  - classic

  - black rock
- Hook in a datastore (most likely mongo)
- Stateful API
- Hearthstone from CLI application
